    text: Why? Rubinschwein47
      There isnt much behind it honestly. In Third grade(around 9) i chose this name without any apparent reason and i stuck it ever since.
      Between then and now i've tried turning this into my online which i slowly improved.
      For quite some time i have also ben using Ruby and RS47, simply because they sound a bit more professional.
